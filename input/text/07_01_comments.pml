[ch title=Comments

    A comment starts with [c \[--] and ends with [c --\]]. Comments can appear anywhere and they can be nested to any level. Text within comments is ignored.

    Example:
    
    [list
        [el title = PML code:
            [code
                This is [-- good --] awesome.
                [-- TODO: explain why --]
