[ch title=Escaping Reserved Characters

    As seen already, characters [c \[] and [c \]] define the start and end of a node. Moreover, character [c \=] is used to assign a value to an attribute.

    Therefore, if these characters are used in text, they must be escaped, to avoid confusion. This is done by prefixing the character with a backslash ([c \\ ]). For instance, instead of writing [c \[], we have to write [c \\\[].

    As a backslash is used as escape character, it must itself also be escaped when it is used in text. Hence, instead of writing [c \\ ], we have to write [c \\\\ ].

    Here is an example to demonstrate how escaping works:

    [list
        [el title = PML code:
            [code
                File path \= C:\\tests\\example.txt

                Instead of writing \\, we have to write \\\\

                Instead of writing \[, we have to write \\\[
            code]
        ]

        [el title = Result:
            File path \= C:\\tests\\example.txt

            Instead of writing \\, we have to write \\\\

            Instead of writing \[, we have to write \\\[
        ]
    ]

    The final rule is simple: Characters [c \[], [c \]], [c \=], and [c \\ ] must be preceded by [c \\ ] when they are used in normal text.
